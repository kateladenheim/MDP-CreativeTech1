            </div>
            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"Why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical making’ seems odd to most of us? I believe this stems from a continuing separation in Western society between ‘thinking’, which is understood as happening primarily in the mind or at most through the mediation of language, and ‘making’, which is understood as an a-conceptual, a-linguistic, and habitual form of interaction with the world."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I read this article immediately after finishing a section of Arturo Escobar's <i>Designs for the Pluriverse: Radical Interdependence, Autonomy, and the Making of Worlds,</i> a Critical Worldviews reading assignment. I see this question as a response to the eurocentric, dualistic worldview that Escobar critiques. in <i>Designs for the Pluriverse.</i> This worldview relies on the separation of the rational mind from the body, as well as the emphasis on the individual as separate from the material and spiritual world. In this sense we could consider critical making as an embrace of a more relational worldview, even as it sits within institutions (universities) that support rationalist dualisms in their structures and systems.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">...the movement to the material world often seems to be accompanied by a less functionalist, more emotional and embodied reaction to the topics under construction/discussion. Together, the ‘push-back’ of the material and the embodied and affectual nature of students’ responses to it can engender a more invested and involved participant."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I continue to be challenged in my notions of what embodiment means or signifies. As a trained, professional dancer, I usually define embodied experiences as ones that are full-bodied and expansive, requiring the use of larger, satisfying motions through space. However, I understand that this is not how most consider or experience embodiment — something I think this section emphasizes and illuminates. In response to this passage, I can understand these (small) technologies (with limited motion capacity) for making as an embodiment of digital processes under consideration; that is to say, material gives a body or otherwise expressive form to what is often invisibilized. The example later provided of a book that 'self-destructs' when copied also underscores such an expressive, embodied action — as a rather literal metaphor for explosive destruction, bleeding, and obscuration.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"Rather than replacing professional design expertise and skill, our sense is that by encouraging and supporting design methodologies for non-traditional design ends – such as the socio-technical critique that is the main goal of critical making – open design helps bring about a kind of socio-technical literacy that is necessary to reconnect materiality and morality."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I find myself thinking here about horizontal power structures and working against knowledge hoarding. Much of this article posits that technology producers assume a certain level of technical and making illiteracy upon which their businesses thrive. If nobody else can make a smartphone, then smartphone companies maintain dominance over the market. Further, they maintain a more insidious monopoly on systems surrounding privacy, infrastructure, supply chains, intellectual property and more briefly mentioned in the article — noto to mention, it upholds a certain mythology around technology as magical or untouchable, something only exceptional people can make or understand. I am encouraged by the idea of critical making as a means of pulling back the curtain on these systems.  </p>
