                        <p>To create an electronic creature that perceives its environment and communicates with other electronic creatures, created by Christie & Isabelle.</p>
                        <h3>Process</h3>
                        <p>Obviously, I had a really elegant plan for this whole thing from the outset that manifested itself seamlessly from start to finish. The following outlines the steps of said magnificent manifestation.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Step 1: Our first workshop helped me get a potentiometer and a pressure sensor hooked up to a website coded in p5.js where I could make a red circle expand and contract based on sensor data.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Step 2: I changed the p5.js to be a little weirdo soft body blobby guy, because the first hope for my digital creature involved a breath sensor that noted the pressure of my torso expanding during inhalation and exhalation. Maxim suggested that there was a better way to construct a breath sensor, so he suggested I get conductive rubber stretch cord instead.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I waited 10 days for conductive rubber stretch cord to arrive.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Meanwhile, I tried to improve blobby guy by making the background color change, but also started getting woried that breath sensor and blobby guy weren't really hitting the brief. I researched parasitic and symbiotic relationships for creature models and electronic form factors, and had a really hard time landing on anything feasable and compelling given our time constraints and my budget constraints and the fact that my conductive rubber stretch cord still hadn't shown up. Much hand flapping occurred, in addition to questions around ability and self worth. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I decided to take stock of what I did have, which included several LED lights, potentiometers, a small hobby motor, diode, and transistor, and plenty of gaff and electrical tape. My concept morphed into a medusa of sorts, with a few dangling lights. When the stretch cord arrived, I could make it an attachment, and have a weight on it that the motor would shake, changing the amount of stretch. Finally — direction!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Christie, Isabelle and I had an * i n p e r s o n * sociallly distant meet up where we managed to get our bot prototypes talking to each other, using potentiometers as sensors and lights as expressive elements. This formed the base code for our more complex creatures.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                My stretch cord arrived! But it came with alligator clips with no breadboard wires attached. I was able to clip breadboard wires to do some testing, but my numbers were pretty wonky.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Isabelle to the rescue! Back to her place for a quick solder.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                SO now, lights were go, thermistor was hooked up and getting readings, the motor was attached to a diode and a transistor and a resistor, but it wouldn't ever turn off. Nothing can ever be easy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Maxim informed me that things were actually quite a bit easier than I was making them, and all I needed was a diode and I could lose a whole bunch of breadboard wires and simplify my code.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After some code wrangling and connectivity issues, I and the rest of my group got our proto bots happily communicating with each other.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                But wait! What about blobby guy? Well, blobby guy got the axe because he no longer had anything to do with my evolving medusa, now slowly taking shape. But evolving medusa <a href="/MDP-CreativeTech1/ecologies">had to express herself on the web somehow</a> — I took inspiration from my group's sensor mechanics and made little wordplays responding to stretching, touch-based warnings, and light sensitivity. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Even though medusa has a kitchen bowl for a hat, and the motor is too weak to actually affect the stretch sensor, and blobby guy no longer exists, and my text website is potentially conceptually... erm... lame, I did learn quite a bit from this project. Namely: the structural underpinnings of device communication; how to (smoothly!) morph text with p5.js; how to represent sensor-based data via p5.js; and the merits of removing redundancies for the speed and efficiency of code.
                            </li>

                <p class = "quote">"This is real. A Scrum Master in ninja socks has come into your office and said, “We’ve got to budget for apps.” Should it all go pear-shaped, his career will be just fine."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">There's nothing particularly fascinating about this quote, but it does point to the overall tone in the article which I find perplexing. He seems to address both corporate managers and coders with a healthy dose of irony bordering on contept — and I'm not entirely certain what the author is trying to critique. Stayed corporate practices? The annoying cultural tropes of millennial developers? I think the attempt is to use humor to make an intimidating topic relatable, but I think the effect is actually just alienating and distracting. The article is at its strongest not during these awkward corporate anecdotes, but when explaining how a computer understands code and how long code has been a major part of our lives.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"As was written in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (aka SICP), the seminal textbook of programming taught for years at MIT, “A computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations … it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”"</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I really resonate with this quote — not only because it rings true to my experience, but also because of the article's regular insistence on "computers as dumb rocks." I respond negatively to assertions that we are close to AI or singularity, that robots will take over the world, that machines are smarter or more capable than humans. 18 months of work at a Robotics lab has only proven that humans are more flexible, facile, and creative than machines can ever be. It is the manipulation of our tools (computers and machines) that enables innovation, not the other way around.</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This is not to insist that technology isn't a manipulative force in contemporary life — a quick trip into Instagram is sufficient to prove otherwise. However, this is because of its design and construction, led by humans, and shaped by popular culture and market values.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"Disruption is just optimization by another name."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">Optimization is, famously, one of my obsessions as a designer. I'm in terested in it as a technical process in addition to a lifestyle goal surrounded by a created aesthetic. I think the same could be said for disruption — not only is it a technical buzzword, but there are cultural references for what it means to disrupt or to be a disruptor. Both of these ideas are aspirational, and they have stereotypical gender connotations: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour">women are to be optimized or idealized,</a> men to disrupt (as it isn't usually encouraged for women to be disruptive). This was a flippant, irreverant statement in the article's conclusion, but perhaps merits some thought with respect to the previously noted gender disparities amongst coders and what, culturally, might discourage women from being engaged in programming to begin with.</p>

                <p class = "quote">"If the Radioscape was unfeasible for practical reasons, however, its desirability was underscored by our tests. In wandering the countryside’s ambient soundscape, we gave flesh to the sketches, diagrams, and particularly the interactive simulation with which we had explored the initial proposal for a Pastoral Radioscape. Focusing on recording heightened our awareness of the landscape as an auditory experience, and we began to appreciate the diversity of sounds we could find there. Most importantly, the group of older people joined us in our exploration. Not only did they use the maps to point out locations we might search for sounds, but they joined us on our expedition into the countryside, helping us locate suitable sites for recording, negotiating with local farmers to give us access to the animals, and listening to the results with enjoyment. This success actually helped dissuade us from pursuing the system further: convinced that it would work, we saw little intellectual challenge in attacking purely political obstacles to its development."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I find this a particularly compelling example of taking learnings from an incomplete system. Rather than considering the entire experiment a failure, the designers were able to tune their work to the people for whom it truly mattered: the older citizens of Peccioli. It highlighted the most important parts of the project: the materials (aural landscape), the interaction (older citizens as tour guides for the sounds of their town), and reflection (being able to share in the collected sounds).</p>

                <p class = "quote">"Finally it dawned on us that when a public phone rings, the one thing certain is that it’s not for you. The volume of the ring or location of the booth is irrelevant unless the possibility of an incoming call being meaningful is conveyed clearly."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This experiment is, to me, charmingly retro. I've never lived in a world where answering payphones was ecouraged or plausible — and I think even when this practice was more commonplace convincing others to answer a message from strangers for the joy of an experiment is unlikely. The designers go on to note the possibility of constructing specialized booths for the experiment, which I think is the most promising option. I'm curious about how this turns out because I'm deeply skeptical of the premise.</p>

                <p class = "quote">"In part, the success of the Bijlmer test was due to the lack of any technical failures. Beyond this, however, the situation in the Bijlmer presented us with more complex and richer issues than the other sites, and it was the success of the ideas to raise these social and cultural issues that convinced us to pursue the system further."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">Relating this to the previous reading, sometimes the most effective prototypes are the simplest options. What is the lowest impact form needed to test a specific aspect of the project? In this case, cards and projected iages provided a sort of ephemeral, fleeting tease to get folks interested and involved, effectively testing the role of the design intervention in the lives of the Bijlmer people.</p>

                <p class = "quote">"Is a brick a prototype? The answer depends on how it is used. If it is used to represent the weight and scale of some future artifact, then it certainly is: it prototypes the weight and scale of the artifact... prototypes are not necessarily self-explanatory.'"</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This gets to the heart of some design mythology I've been fed: that if the design does not stand on its own, then it has failed. Often designs require additional context than can be absorbed from expected interactions. This is especially true for designs that push new roles, and also in earlier prototyping phases. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"The pizza box was a very efficient prototype. Spending virtually no time building it or considering options, the students got useful feedback on a basic design question—what physical form would be best for the user."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I actually disagree with this. It was certainly time and cost effective, but a pizza box is something with really strong cultural connotations. There is a specific way people already expect to hold and interact with it — likely out in front of them, hands beneath or on the sides. It's likely that a user would default to this instead of exploring other options if the item wasn't pre-defined.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"Implementation usually requires a working system to be built; look and feel requires the concrete user experience to be simulated or actually created; role requires the context of the artifact’s use to be established. Being explicit about what design ques- tions must be answered is therefore an essential aid to deciding what kind of prototype to build."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I find this to be a helpful framework for considering prototype types. Admittedly, I'm somewhat new to prototyping; it isn't common terminology in performance settings. However, the issues are translatable: proper testing and iterations from a systems, aesthetic, and contextual standpoint are required for a rigorous and/or usable final product.</p>

            <p class = "quote">"Despite the hive-mind connotations of faceless groups such as Anonymous, the archetype of ‘the hacker’ is essentially that of an individual attempting to live an empowered and unalienated life."</p>
            <p class="quote-response">We're doing some reading in Critical Worldviews class regarding dualist vs. relationist thinking, and western perspectives that center the individual. In that sense, a hacker oculd be an interesting subversion of this idea; that a more or less rogue individual tinkering against the machine can simultaneously support radical ambitions. I think this framework also serves to strengthen Lake's later points about the hacker character being easily appropriated by capitalist mythology.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class = "quote">"This process of gentrification becomes a war over language. If enough newcomers with media clout use the hollowed-out version of the term, its edge grows dull. You end up with a mere affectation, failing to challenge otherwise conventional aspirations. And before you know it, an earnest Stanford grad is handing me a business card that says, without irony: ‘Founder. Investor. Hacker.'"</p>
            <p class="quote-response">Potentially the edge grows dull, but the image becomes shinier. And the affect not only fails to challenge conventional aspirations, it in fact strengthens them. I think there is a rather direct line here from media portrayals of a 'white hat' hacker, executing his individual genius. This specific image of 'hacker' used as self promotion tactic is especially illuminating — this earnest Stanford grad knows this label will make him attractive to business connections.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class = "quote">"Maybe the hackers – like the disenchanted artists and hipsters – are just the vanguard charged with identifying the next profitable investment. Perhaps hacking has always been a contradictory amalgam that combines desire for the unstable and queer with the control impulse of the stable and straight."</p>
            <p class="quote-response">In this brief counter to Lake's assertion that a hacker is essentially nonconformist, there seems to be an acknowledgement of what it means to be part of the problem. Like disenchanted artists and hipsters, we can assume that many hackers enjoy some level of privilege, namely access to tools and talent or knowledge of technical systems. There are also groups of people (men, also a societally privileged group) for whom hacking and tinkering is, largely, more encouraged and socially acceptable. Is the hacker, lone wolf nonconformist, simply benefitting from the very system he hopes to subvert? Or will this figure need to adapt its strategies to hack the hack of his identity?</p>

            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"Why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical making’ seems odd to most of us? I believe this stems from a continuing separation in Western society between ‘thinking’, which is understood as happening primarily in the mind or at most through the mediation of language, and ‘making’, which is understood as an a-conceptual, a-linguistic, and habitual form of interaction with the world."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I read this article immediately after finishing a section of Arturo Escobar's <i>Designs for the Pluriverse: Radical Interdependence, Autonomy, and the Making of Worlds,</i> a Critical Worldviews reading assignment. I see this question as a response to the eurocentric, dualistic worldview that Escobar critiques. in <i>Designs for the Pluriverse.</i> This worldview relies on the separation of the rational mind from the body, as well as the emphasis on the individual as separate from the material and spiritual world. In this sense we could consider critical making as an embrace of a more relational worldview, even as it sits within institutions (universities) that support rationalist dualisms in their structures and systems.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">...the movement to the material world often seems to be accompanied by a less functionalist, more emotional and embodied reaction to the topics under construction/discussion. Together, the ‘push-back’ of the material and the embodied and affectual nature of students’ responses to it can engender a more invested and involved participant."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I continue to be challenged in my notions of what embodiment means or signifies. As a trained, professional dancer, I usually define embodied experiences as ones that are full-bodied and expansive, requiring the use of larger, satisfying motions through space. However, I understand that this is not how most consider or experience embodiment — something I think this section emphasizes and illuminates. In response to this passage, I can understand these (small) technologies (with limited motion capacity) for making as an embodiment of digital processes under consideration; that is to say, material gives a body or otherwise expressive form to what is often invisibilized. The example later provided of a book that 'self-destructs' when copied also underscores such an expressive, embodied action — as a rather literal metaphor for explosive destruction, bleeding, and obscuration.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"Rather than replacing professional design expertise and skill, our sense is that by encouraging and supporting design methodologies for non-traditional design ends – such as the socio-technical critique that is the main goal of critical making – open design helps bring about a kind of socio-technical literacy that is necessary to reconnect materiality and morality."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I find myself thinking here about horizontal power structures and working against knowledge hoarding. Much of this article posits that technology producers assume a certain level of technical and making illiteracy upon which their businesses thrive. If nobody else can make a smartphone, then smartphone companies maintain dominance over the market. Further, they maintain a more insidious monopoly on systems surrounding privacy, infrastructure, supply chains, intellectual property and more briefly mentioned in the article — noto to mention, it upholds a certain mythology around technology as magical or untouchable, something only exceptional people can make or understand. I am encouraged by the idea of critical making as a means of pulling back the curtain on these systems.  </p>
