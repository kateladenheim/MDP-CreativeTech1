                <p>Char Stiles' workshops on creating GLSL shaders felt like an opportunity to reconnect with a child brain. While some of the mathematical concepts were challenging to fully grasp, playing with the shaders felt like an improvisation practice; using code as a framework for experimentation and subtle change rather than a pathway towards executing a specific vision. These workshops reminded me of our first readings back in week 2 around critical making: creating something as a research and discovery methodology in and of itself.</p>

                    <h3 class="top-title">goal:</h3>
                    <p>To create an electronic creature that perceives its environment and communicates with other electronic creatures, created by Christie & Isabelle. These creatures would also send data to a web page that visually communicated some aspects of this data, and how the bots were connected.</p>
                    <h3>process</h3>
                    <p>Obviously, I had a really rigorous concept out the gate, as well as an elegant plan that manifested itself seamlessly from start to finish. The following outlines the steps of said magnificent manifestation. ;-) </p>
                </div>
                <div class="two-col">

                            <li>
                                The first hope for my digital creature involved a pressure sensor activated by my torso expanding during inhalation and exhalation. Representative of this, I found a p5.js soft body blobby guy, who zoomed along on a diagonal in response to the pressure sensor; I was interested in iterating on the breathy and interactive qualities of this sketch. However, my breath sensor wasn't getting even readings. Maxim suggested I get conductive rubber stretch cord instead to construct a more robust breath sensor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                While I waited for conductive rubber stretch cord to arrive, I worked on improving blobby guy by making the background color change. However, I was concerned that the breath sensor and blobby guy weren't really hitting the brief. I researched parasitic and symbiotic relationships for creature models and electronic form factors, and had a really hard time landing on anything feasable and compelling given our time constraints and my budget constraints and the fact that my conductive rubber stretch cord still hadn't shown up. Much hand flapping occurred, in addition to spiraling questions around my apparent inability to generate any interesting ideas. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I decided to take stock of what sensors and expressive elements I did have, which included several LED lights, potentiometers, a small hobby motor, diode, and transistor, and plenty of gaff and electrical tape. I let go of the need for my creature to be dependent on or use data from my body, and thought also about what my teammates were trying to sense. Isabelle was using a flex sensor to notice touch, which would trigger a "don't touch me" warning light. Christie was using a photoresistor, which would impact a flocking pattern on screen. I started to think of ideas around visibility, masking, and subtle motion. As I looked at and started to compile my materials, a concept started to take shape. I could create with a few dangling lights with extended wires and use a motor for additional expression. The medusa would have a relationship with Isabelle's warning lights, and when hers went on, so would my dangling ones. Christie's photoresistor would activate the hobby motor. When the stretch cord arrived, I could make it another dangling appendage, and attach a weight to it. When the motor activated, it would aggravate the stretch cord. The overall effect of the creature would look like a jellyfish or a medusa of sorts. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Christie, Isabelle and I had a sociallly distant meet up where we managed to get our bot prototypes talking to each other, using potentiometers as sensors and lights as expressive elements. This formed the base code for our more complex creatures; with this communication established, we could replace the potentiometer with our own sensors as our individual creatures took shape.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once there was a physical form, I went back to my website. Blobby guy no longer seemed relevant to what I and my teammates were building. Thus, I took further inspiration from my group's sensor mechanics and made little wordplays responding to stretching, touch-based warnings, and light sensitivity.

                        <p>Medusa, in her current form, has a kitchen bowl for a hat. The motor is too weak to actually affect the stretch sensor at all, and I'm using an extremely ugly keychain for the weight. Blobby guy has sadly disappeared to the depths of my archived code, and my text website looks okay and functions properly, but is perhaps a little didactic in its interpretation of our physical objects and their related emotionalities. The diagram at right offers a potential improvement to this project, responding to its current form with more considered structure and materials.</p>
                        <p>But! I did learn quite a bit from this project. Namely: the structural underpinnings of device communication; how to (smoothly!) morph text with p5.js; that push() and pop() can be used to effectively layer elements better than trying to add multiple scripts and divs to a p5.js web project; how to represent sensor-based data via p5.js; the merits of removing redundancies for the speed and efficiency of code; and that usually things are a hell of a lot simpler than I'm making them. Check out the videos below to see medusa and the typographic website up and running.</p>

            </div>
    
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"...electronic art has become so technology-driven that it seems concerned only with the aesthetic expression of technology for its own sake. Rather than relating the impact of technology to everyday life, art criticism in this area glamorizes technology as a source of aesthetic effect to be experienced in galleries. The exceptions tend to be based on electronic systems rather than objects (e.g., in the work of Roy Ascott).""</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This passage initially surprised me — it felt somewhat reductive — but I think after sitting with the full article and with some other artworks, I might come around to agreeing with it as a generalization. Particularly with tech-driven performance works, there is a risk that the work can feel like a tech demo; an impressive technical display disconnected from the materials of the body or of the surrounding environment. The immediate works I come up with that respond to technology — Keiken's empathetic face filters, Michelle Ellsworth's absurdist archival projects and recent work with GANs, Refik Anadol's machine dreams and Stelarc's machine augmented performances deeply integrate with systems. However, an exception I can think of are instagrammable immersive experiences (Meow Wolf, 29 Rooms) integrate complex interactive systems with technology to commercial ends — visually appealling, conceptually thin.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"...the conflict between the solidity of the object and the fluidity of electronic media. Design is viewed here as a strategy for linking the immaterial snd the material."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This small idea jumped out at me as one that I grapple with in my own work, in this past semester and also before coming to MDP. The solidity of the object in question, for my own work, generally concerns the body and physical space; the fluidity of electronic media concerns virtual reactions that maintain resonance after screens and machines are switched off. There is much to contemplate around the material of digital matter: social interaction, performative design, interfaces, and how they choreograph and influence our lives in meatspace. Extending beyond the body, making digital and electronic encounters feel 'immaterial' and 'fluid' takes incredible physical resources — electronic power plants and server farms, underground and underwater wiring, and more. Beyond, it's possible to physically perceive the air as 'charged', materially different if not purely visible.</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This point is further underscored by Moles citation on page 13: "Behind every outward image or symbol lies mechanical support, and if the imateriality of these images and sybols gives rise to a new approach to the relationship between human being and object, the analysis will be one of the individual's connection with the material support underlying the new culture of immateriality."</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"Perhaps the 'object' can locate the electronic in the social and cultural context of everyday life. It could link the richness of material culture with the new functional and expressive qualities of electronic technology."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This is an exciting provocation. Electronics, machines, and digital matter are (arguably) already ubiquitous in every day life. We are used to interacting with them and relying on them for conveniences, connection, work, and increasingly, social life. However, there is a persistent disconnect between their effects and the materials that enable them — and further, a predictable aesthetic around what they must look like and what roles in modern life they perform. This quote feels almost like a call to action, echoed again at the end of the article — that complicating expected expressions of functionality and practicality with aesthetics and poetics is the domain of a designer, key in pulling away from a homogenized electronic/digital expression.</p>

                <p class = "quote">"More elaborate models measure heart rate, breathing, skin temperature and even perspiration—biological primitives from which higher-order, harder-to-define psychoemotional states like stress, boredom or arousal can be inferred."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">Very early on in this article, we are introduced to the disparity between what data is collected and what is then intuited or interpreted from said collected data. A heart rate increase could mean that I am stressed, it could also mean I had a particularly strong cup of coffee, it could also mean that I am exercising. A heart rate sensor cannot know these differences, only the spike in numbers. The interpretation is left up to human expectation and fallability. Zooming out from the body later in the article, this point is underscored when thinking about city-scale interactions: walking speed becomes the pace of urban life, the number of patents an indicator of how innovative an entire city is.</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I felt this in connection to our own projects as well. A reading on a potentiometer could mean that it's nighttime, that the robot is covered up. We could attach emotional or anthropomorphized connotations to this: the robot is hiding, it's asleep. In fact, it's just sensing light levels, which are altered by a number of environmental phenomena and human activity that is impossible to know from the photoresistor itself. In other words: data offers some information, but not necessarily a full picture.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"Almost without exception, these assistants are given female names, voices and personalities, presumably based on research conducted in North America indicating that users of all genders prefer to interact with women."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I am somewhat excited to see this point made, as it's one I also drew out in a paper I recently wrote! Service bots, in particular ones that are connected to home-making and home management, largely default feminine in physical and audio design. This deepens existing gender divides about who is responsible for this work and how it is valued or not. Further, that these decisions were made in result to user studies 'preferring' this to be a feminine voice just underscores this already existing stereotype. Designers chose to honor this data and thus maintain this expectation.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"It seems strange to assert that anything as broad as a class of technologies might have a dominant emotional tenor, but the internet of things does. That tenor is sadness. When we pause to listen for it, the overriding emotion of the internet of things is a melancholy that rolls off of it in waves and sheets. The entire pretext on which it depends is a milieu of continuously shattered attention, of overloaded awareness, and of gaps between people just barely annealed with sensors, APIs and scripts."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I found this passage poetic and resonant. This is how I feel, too, when I think of the ways that my body, home, community, and environment is surveilled. I am sadder still when I feel like I can't opt out of this; that this surveillance is something that I opt in to as social hazing and exists in infrastructure both visible and invisible. I am sad to think of my body, home, community, and surrounding environment as a test site for capitalist aims. Calling out the emotional tenor of IoT speaks to me as a designer — is it possible to make this emotional tenor less melancholic? Would that involve rejecting it altogether?</p>

                <p class = "quote">"This is an exercise in fictional science, or science fiction, if you like that better. Not for amusement: science fiction in the service of science. Or just science, if you agree that fiction is part of it, always was, and always will be as long as our brains are only miniscule fragments of the universe, much too small to hold all the facts of the world but not too idle to speculate about them."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">As an opening paragraph, I found this incredibly endearing. I appreciate the writing choices of blunt sentences and charming quips. I also deeply resonate with this sentiment: that there are poetics to our conceptions of science and that our imaginations are what hold the potential for discovery and progress.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"But, you will say, this is ridiculous: knowledge implies a flow of information from the environment into a living being or at least into something like a living being. There was no such transmission of information here. We were just playing with sensors, motors, and connections: the properties that happened to emerge may look like knowledge but really are not. We should be careful with such words."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This is generally the theory that I subscribe to: machines are not humans, computers are not humans. I simultaneously thing that one of the things that makes us most human is the ability to see meaning or emotionality in non-emotional things. This reminds me a lot of <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/animating-anthropomorphism-giving-minds-to-geometric-shapes-video/">the Heider and Simmel study.</a> This simple animation from 1944 shows a collection of shapes moving around a screen. Though it was not designed with a story in mind, it's easy for most viewers to see a narrative and strong emotionality associated with the shapes and their interactions.</p>

                <p class = "quote">"These creatures, the observer would say, ponder over their DECISIONS... You would almost be tempted to say: where decisions are being made, there must be a WILL to make them. Why not? For all we know, this is not the worst criterion for establishing the existence of free will.</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This ending quote gave me the warm feeling to the book as the opener. I also find this a helpful reduction of the conditions that create perceptions of free will. This reminds me of a book I read recently called <a href="https://www.eagleman.com/incognito">Incognito,</a> about the many invisible brain processes that make us functional social beings — most of these processes buried or unnoticed. The book argues that free will is more of a fallacy than a reality. As a thought experiment for the creation of machines/organisms, there is an interesting parallel at play.</p>

                <h3>creating a simulation in unity</h3>
                <p>I'm writing this reflection with some space from the project, and with distance I'm able to look at the twists, turns, and frustrations in working with Unity much more graciously and generously. Projects involving creative technology are always a negotiation between vision and capacity — and it's truly what I like about working in this space. Your imagination is inherently curbed by possibility, which grounds your expression and the impacts it can have.</p>
                <p>Less poetically, a lack of technical competency can also make work clunky and unapproachable. Technical facility always enables the perception of magic — so how can this be created when technical facility is absent?</p>
                <P>My first hope for this project, inspired by the word 'melting,' was to spawn endless human bodies that would melt into liquid upon contact with a surface. This liquid would accumulate over time, drowning the new bodies as they morph from solid to liquid. I was promptly notified that fluid dynamics are the domain of multi-year PhD candidates in math and computer science, from Tim and John as well as my own PhD mathematician brother gently scoffing at my baby programming skills. I attempted a number of unsuccessful workarounds to create a melting body effect — namely, unity shaders (which only worked on a single object and needed to be manually activated) and soft body physics (which needed to be time and processor-intensively mapped to each mesh object as it collided with a floor) — before succumbing to the fact that I would need to perform some kind of technical sleight of hand.</p>

                    <p>The resulting project utilized rag doll physics to create more responsive bodies that disappeared into a fluid-seeming metallic block as they dropped from a spawner. While not an elegant fluid simulation, this programming creates a similar affective response: too many bodies disappearing into themselves, failing to stay 'above water' as they accumulate. The rag doll physics here are particularly effective, creating disjointed, rippling motion as the bodies collide with each other.</p>
                    <p>With the benefit of distance, I think this is the project that I am most proud of creating this semester. It was absolutely instrumental in supporting my work in Studio 2 and in thinking through the potential of the accumulating body in virtual space, affectively untethered by physical form.</p>

                <p class="quote-response">There's nothing particularly fascinating about this quote, but it does point to the overall tone in the article which I find perplexing. He seems to address both corporate managers and coders with a healthy dose of irony bordering on contept — and I'm not entirely certain what the author is trying to critique. Stayed corporate practices? The annoying cultural tropes of millennial developers? I think the attempt is to use humor to make an intimidating topic relatable, but I think the effect is actually just alienating and distracting. The article is at its strongest not during these awkward corporate anecdotes, but when explaining how a computer understands code and how long code has been a major part of our lives.</p>

Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”"</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I really resonate with this quote — not only because it rings true to my experience, but also because of the article's regular insistence on "computers as dumb rocks." I respond negatively to assertions that we are close to AI or singularity, that robots will take over the world, that machines are smarter or more capable than humans. 18 months of work at a Robotics lab has only proven that humans are more flexible, facile, and creative than machines can ever be. It is the manipulation of our tools (computers and machines) that enables innovation, not the other way around.</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This is not to insist that technology isn't a manipulative force in contemporary life — a quick trip into Instagram is sufficient to prove otherwise. However, this is because of its design and construction, led by humans, and shaped by popular culture and market values.</p>

                <p class = "quote">"Disruption is just optimization by another name."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">Optimization is, famously, one of my obsessions as a designer. I'm in terested in it as a technical process in addition to a lifestyle goal surrounded by a created aesthetic. I think the same could be said for disruption — not only is it a technical buzzword, but there are cultural references for what it means to disrupt or to be a disruptor. Both of these ideas are aspirational, and they have stereotypical gender connotations: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour">women are to be optimized or idealized,</a> men to disrupt (as it isn't usually encouraged for women to be disruptive). This was a flippant, irreverant statement in the article's conclusion, but perhaps merits some thought with respect to the previously noted gender disparities amongst coders and what, culturally, might discourage women from being engaged in programming to begin with.</p>

                <p class = "quote">"If the Radioscape was unfeasible for practical reasons, however, its desirability was underscored by our tests. In wandering the countryside’s ambient soundscape, we gave flesh to the sketches, diagrams, and particularly the interactive simulation with which we had explored the initial proposal for a Pastoral Radioscape. Focusing on recording heightened our awareness of the landscape as an auditory experience, and we began to appreciate the diversity of sounds we could find there. Most importantly, the group of older people joined us in our exploration. Not only did they use the maps to point out locations we might search for sounds, but they joined us on our expedition into the countryside, helping us locate suitable sites for recording, negotiating with local farmers to give us access to the animals, and listening to the results with enjoyment. This success actually helped dissuade us from pursuing the system further: convinced that it would work, we saw little intellectual challenge in attacking purely political obstacles to its development."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I find this a particularly compelling example of taking learnings from an incomplete system. Rather than considering the entire experiment a failure, the designers were able to tune their work to the people for whom it truly mattered: the older citizens of Peccioli. It highlighted the most important parts of the project: the materials (aural landscape), the interaction (older citizens as tour guides for the sounds of their town), and reflection (being able to share in the collected sounds).</p>

                <p class = "quote">"Finally it dawned on us that when a public phone rings, the one thing certain is that it’s not for you. The volume of the ring or location of the booth is irrelevant unless the possibility of an incoming call being meaningful is conveyed clearly."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This experiment is, to me, charmingly retro. I've never lived in a world where answering payphones was ecouraged or plausible — and I think even when this practice was more commonplace convincing others to answer a message from strangers for the joy of an experiment is unlikely. The designers go on to note the possibility of constructing specialized booths for the experiment, which I think is the most promising option. I'm curious about how this turns out because I'm deeply skeptical of the premise.</p>

Beyond this, however, the situation in the Bijlmer presented us with more complex and richer issues than the other sites, and it was the success of the ideas to raise these social and cultural issues that convinced us to pursue the system further."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">Relating this to the previous reading, sometimes the most effective prototypes are the simplest options. What is the lowest impact form needed to test a specific aspect of the project?

                <p class = "quote">"Is a brick a prototype? The answer depends on how it is used. If it is used to represent the weight and scale of some future artifact, then it certainly is: it prototypes the weight and scale of the artifact... prototypes are not necessarily self-explanatory.'"</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This gets to the heart of some design mythology I've been fed: that if the design does not stand on its own, then it has failed. Often designs require additional context than can be absorbed from expected interactions. This is especially true for designs that push new roles, and also in earlier prototyping phases. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"The pizza box was a very efficient prototype. Spending virtually no time building it or considering options, the students got useful feedback on a basic design question—what physical form would be best for the user."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I actually disagree with this. It was certainly time and cost effective, but a pizza box is something with really strong cultural connotations. There is a specific way people already expect to hold and interact with it — likely out in front of them, hands beneath or on the sides. It's likely that a user would default to this instead of exploring other options if the item wasn't pre-defined.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"Implementation usually requires a working system to be built; look and feel requires the concrete user experience to be simulated or actually created; role requires the context of the artifact’s use to be established. Being explicit about what design ques- tions must be answered is therefore an essential aid to deciding what kind of prototype to build."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I find this to be a helpful framework for considering prototype types. Admittedly, I'm somewhat new to prototyping; it isn't common terminology in performance settings. However, the issues are translatable: proper testing and iterations from a systems, aesthetic, and contextual standpoint are required for a rigorous and/or usable final product.</p>

            <p class = "quote">"Despite the hive-mind connotations of faceless groups such as Anonymous, the archetype of ‘the hacker’ is essentially that of an individual attempting to live an empowered and unalienated life."</p>
            <p class="quote-response">We're doing some reading in Critical Worldviews class regarding dualist vs. relationist thinking, and western perspectives that center the individual. In that sense, a hacker oculd be an interesting subversion of this idea; that a more or less rogue individual tinkering against the machine can simultaneously support radical ambitions. I think this framework also serves to strengthen Lake's later points about the hacker character being easily appropriated by capitalist mythology.</p>

            <p class = "quote">"This process of gentrification becomes a war over language. If enough newcomers with media clout use the hollowed-out version of the term, its edge grows dull. You end up with a mere affectation, failing to challenge otherwise conventional aspirations. And before you know it, an earnest Stanford grad is handing me a business card that says, without irony: ‘Founder. Investor. Hacker.'"</p>
            <p class="quote-response">Potentially the edge grows dull, but the image becomes shinier. And the affect not only fails to challenge conventional aspirations, it in fact strengthens them. I think there is a rather direct line here from media portrayals of a 'white hat' hacker, executing his individual genius. This specific image of 'hacker' used as self promotion tactic is especially illuminating — this earnest Stanford grad knows this label will make him attractive to business connections.</p>

Perhaps hacking has always been a contradictory amalgam that combines desire for the unstable and queer with the control impulse of the stable and straight."</p>
            <p class="quote-response">In this brief counter to Lake's assertion that a hacker is essentially nonconformist, there seems to be an acknowledgement of what it means to be part of the problem. Like disenchanted artists and hipsters, we can assume that many hackers enjoy some level of privilege, namely access to tools and talent or knowledge of technical systems. There are also groups of people (men, also a societally privileged group) for whom hacking and tinkering is, largely, more encouraged and socially acceptable. Is the hacker, lone wolf nonconformist, simply benefitting from the very system he hopes to subvert? Or will this figure need to adapt its strategies to hack the hack of his identity?</p>

                <p class = "quote">"Why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical making’ seems odd to most of us? I believe this stems from a continuing separation in Western society between ‘thinking’, which is understood as happening primarily in the mind or at most through the mediation of language, and ‘making’, which is understood as an a-conceptual, a-linguistic, and habitual form of interaction with the world."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I read this article immediately after finishing a section of Arturo Escobar's <i>Designs for the Pluriverse: Radical Interdependence, Autonomy, and the Making of Worlds,</i> a Critical Worldviews reading assignment. I see this question as a response to the eurocentric, dualistic worldview that Escobar critiques. in <i>Designs for the Pluriverse.</i> This worldview relies on the separation of the rational mind from the body, as well as the emphasis on the individual as separate from the material and spiritual world. In this sense we could consider critical making as an embrace of a more relational worldview, even as it sits within institutions (universities) that support rationalist dualisms in their structures and systems.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">...the movement to the material world often seems to be accompanied by a less functionalist, more emotional and embodied reaction to the topics under construction/discussion. Together, the ‘push-back’ of the material and the embodied and affectual nature of students’ responses to it can engender a more invested and involved participant."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I continue to be challenged in my notions of what embodiment means or signifies. As a trained, professional dancer, I usually define embodied experiences as ones that are full-bodied and expansive, requiring the use of larger, satisfying motions through space. However, I understand that this is not how most consider or experience embodiment — something I think this section emphasizes and illuminates. In response to this passage, I can understand these (small) technologies (with limited motion capacity) for making as an embodiment of digital processes under consideration; that is to say, material gives a body or otherwise expressive form to what is often invisibilized. The example later provided of a book that 'self-destructs' when copied also underscores such an expressive, embodied action — as a rather literal metaphor for explosive destruction, bleeding, and obscuration.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"Rather than replacing professional design expertise and skill, our sense is that by encouraging and supporting design methodologies for non-traditional design ends – such as the socio-technical critique that is the main goal of critical making – open design helps bring about a kind of socio-technical literacy that is necessary to reconnect materiality and morality."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I find myself thinking here about horizontal power structures and working against knowledge hoarding. Much of this article posits that technology producers assume a certain level of technical and making illiteracy upon which their businesses thrive. If nobody else can make a smartphone, then smartphone companies maintain dominance over the market. Further, they maintain a more insidious monopoly on systems surrounding privacy, infrastructure, supply chains, intellectual property and more briefly mentioned in the article — noto to mention, it upholds a certain mythology around technology as magical or untouchable, something only exceptional people can make or understand. I am encouraged by the idea of critical making as a means of pulling back the curtain on these systems.  </p>
