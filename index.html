        <div class="quote-container">
            <p class = "quote">"Despite the hive-mind connotations of faceless groups such as Anonymous, the archetype of ‘the hacker’ is essentially that of an individual attempting to live an empowered and unalienated life."</p>
            <p class="quote-response">We're doing some reading in Critical Worldviews class regarding dualist vs. relationist thinking, and western perspectives that center the individual. In that sense, a hacker oculd be an interesting subversion of this idea; that a more or less rogue individual tinkering against the machine can simultaneously support radical ambitions. I think this framework also serves to strengthen Lake's later points about the hacker character being easily appropriated by capitalist mythology.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class = "quote">"This process of gentrification becomes a war over language. If enough newcomers with media clout use the hollowed-out version of the term, its edge grows dull. You end up with a mere affectation, failing to challenge otherwise conventional aspirations. And before you know it, an earnest Stanford grad is handing me a business card that says, without irony: ‘Founder. Investor. Hacker.'"</p>
            <p class="quote-response">Potentially the edge grows dull, but the image becomes shinier. And the affect not only fails to challenge conventional aspirations, it in fact strengthens them. I think there is a rather direct line here from media portrayals of a 'white hat' hacker, executing his individual genius. This specific image of 'hacker' used as self promotion tactic is especially illuminating — this earnest Stanford grad knows this label will make him attractive to business connections.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class = "quote">"Maybe the hackers – like the disenchanted artists and hipsters – are just the vanguard charged with identifying the next profitable investment. Perhaps hacking has always been a contradictory amalgam that combines desire for the unstable and queer with the control impulse of the stable and straight."</p>
            <p class="quote-response">In this brief counter to Lake's assertion that a hacker is essentially nonconformist, there seems to be an acknowledgement of what it means to be part of the problem. Like disenchanted artists and hipsters, we can assume that many hackers enjoy some level of privilege, namely access to tools and talent or knowledge of technical systems. There are also groups of people (men, also a societally privileged group) for whom hacking and tinkering is, largely, more encouraged and socially acceptable. Is the hacker, lone wolf nonconformist, simply benefitting from the very system he hopes to subvert? Or will this figure need to adapt its strategies to hack the hack of his identity?</p>

                <h2>Reading Quotes & Responses</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"Why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical making’ seems odd to most of us? I believe this stems from a continuing separation in Western society between ‘thinking’, which is understood as happening primarily in the mind or at most through the mediation of language, and ‘making’, which is understood as an a-conceptual, a-linguistic, and habitual form of interaction with the world."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I read this article immediately after finishing a section of Arturo Escobar's <i>Designs for the Pluriverse: Radical Interdependence, Autonomy, and the Making of Worlds,</i> a Critical Worldviews reading assignment. I see this question as a response to the eurocentric, dualistic worldview that Escobar critiques. in <i>Designs for the Pluriverse.</i> This worldview relies on the separation of the rational mind from the body, as well as the emphasis on the individual as separate from the material and spiritual world. In this sense we could consider critical making as an embrace of a more relational worldview, even as it sits within institutions (universities) that support rationalist dualisms in their structures and systems.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">...the movement to the material world often seems to be accompanied by a less functionalist, more emotional and embodied reaction to the topics under construction/discussion. Together, the ‘push-back’ of the material and the embodied and affectual nature of students’ responses to it can engender a more invested and involved participant."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I continue to be challenged in my notions of what embodiment means or signifies. As a trained, professional dancer, I usually define embodied experiences as ones that are full-bodied and expansive, requiring the use of larger, satisfying motions through space. However, I understand that this is not how most consider or experience embodiment — something I think this section emphasizes and illuminates. In response to this passage, I can understand these (small) technologies (with limited motion capacity) for making as an embodiment of digital processes under consideration; that is to say, material gives a body or otherwise expressive form to what is often invisibilized. The example later provided of a book that 'self-destructs' when copied also underscores such an expressive, embodied action — as a rather literal metaphor for explosive destruction, bleeding, and obscuration.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"Rather than replacing professional design expertise and skill, our sense is that by encouraging and supporting design methodologies for non-traditional design ends – such as the socio-technical critique that is the main goal of critical making – open design helps bring about a kind of socio-technical literacy that is necessary to reconnect materiality and morality."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I find myself thinking here about horizontal power structures and working against knowledge hoarding. Much of this article posits that technology producers assume a certain level of technical and making illiteracy upon which their businesses thrive. If nobody else can make a smartphone, then smartphone companies maintain dominance over the market. Further, they maintain a more insidious monopoly on systems surrounding privacy, infrastructure, supply chains, intellectual property and more briefly mentioned in the article — noto to mention, it upholds a certain mythology around technology as magical or untouchable, something only exceptional people can make or understand. I am encouraged by the idea of critical making as a means of pulling back the curtain on these systems.  </p>
